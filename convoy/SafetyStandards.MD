# Convoy – Safety Standards & CSAE Policy

**Last Updated:** January 2026

Convoy is a trust-first network designed for adult vanlifers and nomads. Safety is foundational to our platform. We maintain a strict zero‑tolerance policy toward child sexual abuse and exploitation (CSAE).

---

## 1. Zero Tolerance Policy

Convoy strictly prohibits any content, behavior, or communication that involves:

* Child sexual abuse material (CSAM)
* Grooming behavior
* Sexual exploitation of minors
* Solicitation of minors
* Sharing, requesting, or distributing illegal explicit material involving minors
* Any content that promotes or facilitates harm toward children

Any account found engaging in such activity will be permanently banned.

---

## 2. Age Requirements

Convoy is intended **only for users aged 18 years or older**.

* Users must meet the minimum age requirement to create an account.
* Accounts suspected of belonging to minors may be suspended pending verification.
* We reserve the right to request age verification where necessary.

---

## 3. Reporting & Moderation

Convoy provides in‑app tools for reporting inappropriate content or behavior.

Users can:

* Report profiles
* Report messages
* Block other users

All reports are reviewed promptly. When necessary, we take actions including:

* Immediate content removal
* Temporary suspension
* Permanent account termination
* Escalation to relevant authorities

Convoy operates as a gated, trust-based community. Messaging is only enabled after mutual convoy acceptance, which reduces unsolicited interactions and enhances user safety.

## 4. Proactive Safety Measures

Convoy incorporates the following safety systems:

* Invite-only or verified access
* Trust-level based feature access
* Controlled messaging (no cold direct messages)
* Real-time moderation review of flagged content
* Strict access control policies in backend systems

We continuously improve our safety systems to protect our community.

## 5. Law Enforcement Cooperation

Convoy complies with applicable laws and regulations regarding child protection.

Where we become aware of credible evidence of child sexual abuse or exploitation, we:

* Preserve relevant records as required by law
* Report appropriate information to relevant law enforcement authorities
* Cooperate fully with official investigations
